# Tone.js Docs

The class file begins with short description of that class followed by a list of the class' members and methods. 

## Constructor

The constructor function shows the parameter names, types and a short description for each paramter. All class constructors in Tone.js accept an object in the constructor. The defaults values for that options object are shown below the constructor. 

## Members

Next are the class members. If the class member has a "<span class="orange">&#8767;</span>" before the name, it is a signal rate property. [Signals](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Signals) are properties which can be scheduled to change and smoothly ramp between values at audio-rate. 

Some members have custom types like [Time]({{site.data.version}}/Type#time) or [Frequency]({{site.data.version}}/Type#frequency). Follow the link to read more about them. 

## Methods

Methods are functions which belong to the class. Each has a function signature which give the parameters' names, types and short descriptions. 

Both the members and methods have a link to the source code in the bottom right side of their descriptions.

		} else {
			//just a class
			window.location = window.location.pathname + hash.substr(1)
